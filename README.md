# Multi-Camera Football Player Tracking System

This project implements a **multi-camera player tracking system** using **YOLOv11** for object detection and **BoxMOT (DeepOCSORT)** for robust tracking. It supports **cross-camera ID matching** between a standard broadcast view and a top-down tacticam view.

Itâ€™s built for sports analytics use cases such as:
- Performance tracking
- Player heatmaps
- Cross-view player analysis

## Core Features

| Feature                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| YOLOv11 Detection             | Detect players and classify them with high confidence. |
| DeepOCSORT + BoxMOT          | Tracks each player across frames in a single camera. |
| Cross-Camera ID Matching     | Uses appearance, position, and motion features. |
| Accuracy Evaluation          | Precision, recall, F1-score based on ID consistency. |
| Visual Analysis              | Match similarity histogram, ID tracking stats, overlays. |

## Setup Instructions

How It Works
1. Detection and Tracking
player_tracker.py uses YOLOv11 + BoxMOT to detect and track players.
It registers new players, tracks their centroids and bounding boxes across frames.

3. Cross-View Player Matching
cross_camera_matcher.py calculates a similarity matrix between two views based on:

- Appearance (color histogram)
- Relative Position
- Motion history

left sied is boadcast tracker and right side is tacticam tracker

it Uses the Hungarian Algorithm for optimal matching.

3. Global ID Management
global_id_manager.py ensures consistent player IDs across both views.
Handles new, disappearing, and reappearing players.
